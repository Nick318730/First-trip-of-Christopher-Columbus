3 August 1492 This morning my crew and I set off for India with three Caravelles: Santa Maria, Pinta and Nina loaned to me by the King of Spain. And’ after a month and a half, the crew has been worrying for a long time that the gusts of wind could head west, making the return journey impossible. 9 September Today everyone is alarmed because a few hours ago many of our resources fell into the sea and two sailors died trying to take them. 11 October 1492 Today I noticed in the sea many elements belonging to forests (branches, flowers, etc.) floating in the ocean, they are positive signs, they make me understand that we are close to land. Tonight, while everyone was resting, I glimpsed a flash of light. 12 October 1492 Today we have finally reached land, after exploring this area I think I will name it San Salvador, I will call it that to celebrate Christianity in Asia. I'm not so satisfied with the riches this territory has, I thought I'd find more. We will definitely do it again later. 28 October 1492 Today we reached another area of ’ India (Cuba). I think I'll call it Isla Juana after the Prince of Austrie. 6 December 1492 Today I am not in a good mood because the ship Santa Maria was shipwrecked on the coast of Hispaniola, it was the best in my fleet. 25 December 1492 Today, using the remains of the caravel, I built a temporary settlement on this island, for 40 of my men. So I can come back for them later and they will have time to settle in while I return to Spain. E’ some time has passed since we left to return to Spain. However, we are facing many storms and tornadoes even if we are struggling to make it for now. 15 March 1493 We finally returned to Spain, the journey was long and difficult for all of us, though
